Step 1:

1. Player Movement: Implement rolling movement (left/right) and jumping.

2. Obstacle Mechanics: Obstacles will destroy the player on collision.

3. Level Design: Create platforms and interactive terrain.

4. Physics Integration: Add realistic gravity and collision responses.

5. Camera Follow System: Ensure the camera follows the player smoothly.

6. Checkpoints & Respawn: Implement respawn points for when the player dies.

7. UI Elements: Add a main menu, pause screen, and level completion screen.

8. Implementing unique movement mechanics: Make the movement unique by adding unique effects.

9. Game Progression: Multiple levels with increasing difficulty.

10. Animations & Visual Effects: Add simple animations and particle effects for movement and destruction.

Step 2:

For this checkpoint, we have implemented the following 4 features:

1. Player Movement: The player can move left/right and jump using keyboard inputs.

2. Obstacle Mechanics: The player gets destroyed upon colliding with an obstacle.

3. Physics Integration: The player is affected by gravity and follows a natural jumping arc.

4. Scene & Character Setup: We created the main game scene and placed the player and obstacles.

Step 3: 

Below is our plan for the next 5 weeks:

Week 1

Improve movement controls and add a camera follow system.

Week 2

Implement checkpoints, respawn mechanics, and game UI.

Week 3

Add level design, including platforms, slopes, and moving objects.

Week 4

Implement sound effects, music, and visual effects (particles/animations).

Week 5

Final testing, debugging, and polishing. Submit the project.
